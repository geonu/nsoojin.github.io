<h1 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: -10px">About</h1>

<div id="rightCol">
  <p>Pragmatic problem solver, strong communicator, and a fast learner.</p>

  <p><b>WEBTOON</b></p>

  <p>I work on iOS apps at <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/" target="_blank">WEBTOON</a>, deploying the app to users across United States, Southeast Asia, etc. </p>

  <p><b>Side Projects</b></p>

  <p>My first iOS app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/security-cards-widget/id949362849" target="_blank">Security Cards Widget</a> was awarded App Store's Best of 2015, Best of 2016, and Best of 2017 apps. </p>

  <p>Created an amusing AR app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/notable-me/id1453810473?l=en" target="_blank">Notable Me</a> which lets you swap your face with figures on dollar bills.</p>

  <p><b>Speaking</b></p>

  <p>Sharing knowledge and ideas is my passion. I spoke at various conferences and meetups in New York, Boston, and Seoul. I also co-organize a monthly iOS meetup, <a href="https://festa.io/hosts/625">Let'Swift Pangyo</a>. Check out my past talks <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/speaking">here</a>. </p>

  <p><b>University</b></p>

  <p>I earned a Bachelor of Business Administration at Yonsei University and graduated NEXT Institute where I majored in Software Engineering and Entrepreneurship.</p>
