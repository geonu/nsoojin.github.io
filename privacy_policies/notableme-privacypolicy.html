<h1>Notable Me Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
	Notable Me uses the device‚Äôs rear camera to detect banknotes and frontal camera to scan your face. Combining these two allows for a unique AR experience ‚Äî augmenting your face onto a bill in real time. In order for this functionality to be possible, the app requires access to your device‚Äôs camera. This access can be toggled on and off at any time in your device‚Äôs settings.
	<br>
	<br>
	The camera images and detected face landmarks data are only used for the intended purposes. The live video feed from front/rear camera is never stored or sent outside your device in any form. Notes are detected using Apple‚Äôs API, and the ‚Äúface-off‚Äù algorithm and image generation runs entirely on your device.
	<br>
	<br>
	Face data of your eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth is never stored remotely, shared with third parties, or even sent to an external server. The face data only remains on your device and never leaves your device at any time.
	<br>
	<br>
	All data is stored on the device only for the duration of your current launch session. Every time you go back to home screen, close the app, or press the restart button, the data is deleted. 
	<br>
	<br>
	If you have any questions, please reach out to me at contact@soojin.ro
	<br>
	<br>
	Thanks for downloading the app.
	<br>
	Have a wonderful day! üòÅ
